                    Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy policy. We also share aggregated, non-identifiable information with third parties. Before sharing this information, we ensure that it cannot identify you as an individual. For example, we regularly release information about the size and growth of our audiences. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.

                        How We Retain Your Personal Information
                    </strong>
                    <p>
                        We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In some circumstances we will anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

                <strong>How We Keep Your Personal Information Secure</strong>
                <p>
                    We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To prevent unauthorized access to your information, Journal Africa uses Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) to ensure secure transmission of your personal data. You should see the padlock symbol in your URL address bar once you are successfully logged into the platform. The URL address will also start with https:// depicting a secure Webpage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Please note that you also have a significant role in protecting your information. No one can see or edit your personal information without knowing your username and password, so do not share these with others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, as the internet is not a secure medium, we cannot guarantee that security breaches will never occur. Accordingly, we are not responsible for the matters, which include actions of hackers and other unauthorized third parties that breach our reasonable security procedure.

                <p>
                    Under data protection laws, you may have rights as an individual in relation to the personal data we hold about you. These rights include:
                </p>
                <ul class="privacy">
                    <li>
                        <span>Access to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and check that we are lawfully processing it. Please note that a data subject access request will attract a fee</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span>
                            Erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. If we were not able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons, you will be notified, if applicable, at the time of your request
                        </span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span>Objection to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms</span>

                    <li>
                        <span>Transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine- readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you. Please note that this request may also attract a fee</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                       <span>Withdrawal of consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent</span>

                <p>
                    We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
